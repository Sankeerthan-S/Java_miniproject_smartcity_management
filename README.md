ABSTRACT:

Tourists and even general people travel from one place to another in order to explore or for employment purposes but before they explore, they want to get an insight data about the place. So, to help them with this, a simple city project can be the best guide for them. It is a web-based application written in Java which basically guides you about the place youâ€™re going to visit. You can access all the details of the city. In this application, users need to sign up by entering input details and then can access all the required details of the city. It contains various modules like admin, tourism, business, and student wherein users can switch to the module as per the requirement. It stores details of a city and displays information about the city such as hotels, shopping marts, restaurants, tourist places, transportation modes, and also some general info. This acts as a guide to the new visitors.
